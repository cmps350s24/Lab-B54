            <h2>The Taj Mahal, Agra</h2>
            <img src="http://heritagegetaways.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Agra-Taj-Mahal-1.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Perhaps India's most recognizable building, the Taj Mahal is also the world's most famous testimony to the power of love. Named after Mumtaz Mahal, the favorite wife of Emperor Shah Jahan, this most beautiful of mausoleums was begun upon her death in 1631 and took 20,000 workmen until 1648 to complete.
                Incorporating many elements of Islamic design including arches, minarets, an onion-shaped dome, and black calligraphy inlaid around the entrance, the Taj Mahal is largely constructed of white marble. Adding to its splendor are delicate inlaid floral patterns and precious and semi-precious stones such as jade, lapis lazuli, diamonds, and mother of pearl.
                The best time to visit is either at dawn or dusk when the atmosphere is brilliantly altered by the change in lighting. If possible, try to catch a view of the Taj Mahal's reflection from the far bank of the Yamuna River-it makes for a memorable (and safe) selfie.</p>

            <h2>Mecca Masjid, Hyderabad</h2>
            <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/IND/india-top-attractions-mecca-masjid.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Construction of Hyderabad's Mecca Masjid, one of the world's largest mosques – and one of the oldest in India – began in 1614 during Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah's reign and took almost 80 years to complete.
                Large enough to accommodate 10,000 worshipers, this beautiful mosque's 15 enormous arches and pillars were each wrought from single slabs of black granite dragged to the site by huge cattle trains reputedly consisting of up to 1,400 bulls.
                Taking its name from the bricks above the central gate that were brought here from Mecca, this impressive complex features highlights such as its main gateway, a huge plaza, and a large manmade pond. There's also a room that houses the hair of Prophet Mohammed.
                Other notable features include inscriptions from the Quran above many of the arches and doors, the exquisite roof of the main hall, and the cornices around the entire mosque structure. Look out for the exquisite floral motifs and friezes over the arches.

            <h2>The Golden City: Jaisalmer</h2>
            <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/IND/india-top-attractions-harmandir-sahib.jpg" alt="">
            <p>So named for the yellow sandstone used in most of its buildings, the Golden City of Jaisalmer is an oasis of splendid old architecture that rises from the sand dunes of the Thar Desert. Once a strategic outpost, today the city is filled with splendid old mansions; magnificent gateways; and the massive Jaisalmer Fort, also known as the Golden Fort, a daunting 12th-century structure that rises high above the town.
                In addition to its palaces, temples, and fine old homes, the fortress boasts 99 bastions along with massive gates leading to its main courtyard where you'll find the seven-story-tall Maharaja's Palace. Started in the early 1500s and added to by successive rulers right up until the 19th century, the palace offers sections open to the public, including areas beautifully decorated with tiles from Italy and China, and intricately carved stone doors.
                There are also a number of Jain temples dating from the 12th to 16th centuries, each decorated with fine marble and sandstone images, palm-leaf manuscripts, and brightly painted ceilings. Be sure to also check out the well-preserved 1,000-year-old library, Gyan Bhandar, with its many 16th-century manuscripts and antiquities.</p>

            <h2>The Red Fort, New Delhi</h2>
            <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/IND/india-top-attractions-red-fort.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Built by Shah Jahan in 1648 as the seat of Mughal power – a role it maintained until 1857 – the magnificent crescent-shaped Red Fort in New Delhi, named after the stunning red sandstone used in its construction, covers a vast area of more than two square kilometers, all of it surrounded by a large moat.
                Highlights include its two largest gates: the impressive Lahore Gate (the fort's main entrance) and the elaborately decorated Delhi Gate, once used by the emperor for ceremonial processions.
                A fun part of a visit is exploring Chatta Chowk, a 17th-century covered bazaar selling everything from jewelry to silk garments, as well as souvenirs and food items. While you can explore the fort yourself, guided tours are offered and provide a fascinating insight into the life and times of the Shah, including a peek into the stunning white marble Hall of Public Audiences (Diwan-i-Am) where he received his subjects.</p>
